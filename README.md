# COVID_19-Spread-Visualization
A project visualizing the spread of COVID-19 around the world, from January 22 to April 5, 2020<br>

Using the dataset COVID-19 from kaggle as mentioned in the notebook, this notebook is a mini-project on visualizing spread of COVID-19 in the world with respect to time. The project is explained, in detail, in the notebook.<br>

Due to Github's inability to render the plots (choropleths created using plotly library and racing bar plot). You can view the notebook online on this <a href=https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rajtulluri/COVID_19-Spread-Visualization/blob/master/Covid-19%20Spread%20Visualizations.ipynb>link</a><br>
Or view the plots, saved in this repo separately.
